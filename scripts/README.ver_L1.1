README for cyclone tracking software L1.1
=========================================

Kevin Keay  Dec 5 2006


Installation
------------

(1) Download: 

http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~kevin/cyc_L1.1/zcyccode.linux.L1.1.zip

to a suitable folder on your system - for illustration, call it: /work/user
Then:

cd /work/user
unzip zcyccode.linux.L1.1.zip

A folder called cyc.dir will be created and the software extracted to it.
You may regard the 'cyclone home directory' as /work/user/cyc.dir.

If you have a Linux OS then you *may* be able to use the precompiled binaries.
Download:

http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~kevin/cyc_L1.1/zcycbin.linux.L1.1.zip

to: /work/user. Then:

cd /work/user
unzip zcycbin.linux.L1.1.zip

The binaries will be placed in: cyc.dir/cycbin


Compilation
-----------

If the binaries don't work then you will need to compile the programs:

1. Follow the instructions below (quick compilation guide) to compile each program.
   The main programs are automatically moved to the directory cyc.dir/cycbin.
   Other programs (most utilities) are automatically moved to the directory cyc.dir/ubin
   after compilation. The NCAR Graphics programs are in binary form and should
   be unzipped into the directory cyc.dir/ubin - applies to conmap and kmapline.

2. In most cases typing in the program name without arguments e.g. cyclocx,
   will provide a quick usage (not fully implemented).


Quick compilation guide
-----------------------

# Main programs

These are assumed to reside in: cyc.dir/cycbin

To make    go to         then

cyclocx   cycloc.dir    type "make cycloc"
trackx    track.dir     type "make track"
tstatx    tstat.dir     type "make tstat"

# Tracking scheme utilities 

These are assumed to reside in: cyc.dir/cycbin

To make    go to         then

psfmx     cycloc.dir    type "make psfm"
trackfmx  track.dir     type "make trackfm"
trackmnx  track.dir     type "make trackmn"

# Extra utilities

These are assumed to reside in: cyc.dir/cycbin

To make    go to                    then

binswap   extra.dir/binswap.dir    type "make"
fderivx   extra.dir/fderiv.dir     type "make"
mapx      extra.dir/map.dir        type "make"
statcycmm extra.dir/statcycmm.dir  type "make"


General utilities
-----------------

If you have a Linux OS then you *may* be able to use the precompiled binaries.

Download:

http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~kevin/cyc_L1.1/zubin.linux.zip

to: /work/user. Then:

cd /work/user
unzip zubin.linux.zip

The binaries will be placed in: cyc.dir/ubin

If the binaries don't work then you will need to compile the programs.

Download:

http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~kevin/cyc_L1.1/zutils.linux.zip

to:  /work/user
Then:

cd /work/user
unzip zutils.linux.zip

Go to: cyc.dir/utils.dir
and type: run-compile
The various binaries will be created in: cyc.dir/ubin

See also: cyc.dir/README.utils


NCAR Graphics
-------------

The optional graphics functionality requires NCAR Graphics. If you have
ncargversion (try: which ncargversion) then you have it. If not, then you
can install the binaries i.e. precompiled programs and libraries, from:

http://ngwww.ucar.edu/ng4.4/download.html

Download and install the appropriate binaries e.g. Red Hat Linux, and follow
the instructions. I installed version 4.4.0 but I think 4.3.x-4.4.x will be
okay.
You have to set the environment variable NCARG_ROOT to the location of the
ncarg folder

e.g. setenv NCARG_ROOT  /work/user/ncarg/

This is mentioned in the NCAR Graphics installation notes.

If you plan to use the sotware under Windows, on the NCAR Graphics distribution page
you will see a Cygwin version indicated. If you don't have Cygwin installed then you
can follow the joint Cygwin - NCAR Graphics for Windows instructions at:

http://ngwww.ucar.edu/ng/cygwin.html


NCAR Graphics utilities
-----------------------

If you have a Linux OS then you *may* be able to use the precompiled binaries.

Download:

http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~kevin/cyc_L1.1/zbin_ncarg.linux.zip

to: /work/user. Then:

cd /work/user
unzip zbin_ncarg.linux.zip

The binaries will be placed in: cyc.dir/ubin

If the binaries don't work then you will need to compile the programs.

Download:

http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~kevin/cyc_L1.1/zutils_ncarg.linux.zip

to:  /work/user
Then:

cd /work/user
unzip zutils_ncarg.linux.zip

conmap
------

Go to: cyc.dir/ncarg.dir/src

cd conmap
run-make

kmapline
--------

Go to: cyc.dir/ncarg.dir/src

cd kmapline
run-make

The binaries conmap and kmapline should now be located in: cyc.dir/ubin

There are some graphics tests in: cyc.dir/ncarg.dir/test


Cyclone tracking package tests
------------------------------

The general test folder is:  cyc.dir/test.dir
i.e. /work/user/cyc.dir/test.dir
