# UDUNITS v1.12
#####################################

This version of udunits is included for use with Cyclocx cyclone tracker utilities.

Recent versions (v 2.x), do not support fortran (as of 2019),
and other pre v2.x versions have some issues compiling in linux.

For Cyclocx utilities, use supplied /bin/udunits.inc file rather than the default version.
The supplied version has been modified to be compatible with the gfortran compiler.

The binary bin/libudunits.a has also been supplied, but can be re-build from the supplied source.

To build binary in linux: 

    1. Ensure installation of
        -gfortran
        -gcc
        -bison

    2. Unzip 'udunits-1.12.11.tar.gz'.

    3. Replace udunits-1.12.11/src/CUSTOMIZE file with version in source folder.

    4. Run udunits-1.12.11/src/configure script

    5. cd to udunits-1.12.11/src and run 'make all' or 'make install'

    6. libudunits.a should be located in udunits-1.12.11/src/lib
